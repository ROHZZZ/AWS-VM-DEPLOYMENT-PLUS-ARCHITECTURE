            <dd>In AWS, a region is a geographical area where AWS data centers, called Availability Zones, are located. These regions are designed to be completely isolated from each other to provide high availability and fault tolerance. Each AWS region is made up of multiple Availability Zones, which are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones within the same region.</dd>
            <dt>INTERNET GATWAY</dt>
            <dd>An internet gateway (IGW) is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It essentially serves as a gateway to the internet for resources within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Amazon Web Services (AWS).</dd>
            <dt>AWS VPC</dt>
            <dd>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to create a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define</dd>
            <dt>AVAILABILTY ZONE</dt>
            <dd>An Availability Zone (AZ) is an isolated location within a region. Each AZ is designed to be physically separate from other AZs, yet interconnected via low-latency, high-throughput links.
                AWS customers can deploy resources (such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, etc.) across multiple AZs to achieve fault tolerance and high availability. In the event of a failure in one AZ, resources in other AZs remain unaffected.</dd>
            <dt>PUBLIC SUBNET AND PRIVATE SUBNET</dt>
            <dd>A public subnet is a subnet within an AWS VPC that has a route to the internet gateway (IGW), allowing resources deployed in that subnet to communicate with the internet.
                Typically, resources that need to be publicly accessible, such as web servers or load balancers, are placed in public subnets.
               <br> A private subnet is a subnet within an AWS VPC that does not have a direct route to the internet. Resources deployed in private subnets cannot communicate directly with the internet.
                Private subnets are commonly used for backend services, databases, or other resources that do not require direct internet access.</dd>
            <dt>EC2 INSTANCES</dt>
            <dd>Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to quickly provision virtual servers (known as instances) to run applications and workloads.
                EC2 instances can be launched in public or private subnets within a VPC, depending on the requirements of your application.
                Instances in public subnets can have public IP addresses and can communicate with the internet directly if the necessary security groups and route tables are configured.</dd>
